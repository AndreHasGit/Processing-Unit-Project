            What is a Central Processing Unit 
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            A <strong>Central Processing Unit (Also known as CPU)</strong> is the computer component that is
            responsible for interpreting and executing most of the commands from the computer's other hardware
            and software. The CPU can come in many different models, ranging from <strong> ONE </strong>  processing core to <strong> SEVENTY-TWO </strong> processing cores.

        <p>
            A modern <strong> Central Processing Unit (CPU) </strong> is usually small and square, with many short, rounded, metallic connectors on its 
            underside. Some older <strong> Central Processing Units (CPUs) </strong> have pins instead of metallic connectors.

            What does a Central Processing Unit connect to
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            The <strong> Central Processing Unit (CPU) </strong> connects to the motherboard, which uses circuits to connect 
            the CPU to the other pieces of hardware, including the memory, the hard drive, the CD/DVD drive, and all of your peripherals. The motherboard is a complex piece of technology, with thousands of circuits to manage the transfer of information and electricity between the other component parts. Most motherboards are green, flat, and take up the entire base of a computer.
